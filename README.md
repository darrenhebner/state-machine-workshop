### About

This repo includes a demo of how state machines can help clean up your code.

### The workshop

In this workshop we will be creating an app that allows us to search for photos of different dog breeds. It will involve handling error states, loading states, and different quirks you need to watch out for when writing async code in React.

The format will look something like:

- Build the app using the "classic" approach ([`initial-approach`](https://github.com/darrenhebner/state-machine-workshop/tree/initial-approach))
- Introduce state charts
- Refactor app to implement our state chart ([`state-machine`](https://github.com/darrenhebner/state-machine-workshop/tree/state-machine))
